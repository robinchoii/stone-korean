            <h3>Our Story</h3>

            <p>Stone Korean Restaurant was founded in 2011 in Redmond, WA.  Our goal was to be the best Korean Restaurant in the Great Seattle area by focusing on two categories: authentic/tasty food and amazing customer service.  We decided on Redmond because it was an area that did not have any Korean Restaurants and owners Diana and Kang Choi wanted to introduce KOrean food to people who have never tried Korean food before.  Diana and Kang owned a Cho Dang Tofu Restaurant and Chicky Pub in the Lynnwood Pal Do World before the market shut down and they sold their business. </p>

            <p>We quickly gained traction in the Redmond and Seattle community for our food and fried chicken.  People were surprised by our excellent customer service.  We had servers who understood customers' needs and was happy to refill table's side dishes or ban chan.  Our chefs were happy to re-make customers' orders if they ordered the wrong dish.  Everything was about making the customer happy through great food and customer service.</p>

            <p>After searching for a second location in the Seattle area for 4 years, we are finally opening our second location after 7 years wince our first day in Redmond.  The management team saw an opportunity for a Korean restaurant in the Seattle area and decided to pen the second location in South Lake Union.</p>
